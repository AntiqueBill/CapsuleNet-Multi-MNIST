Multi-Mnist experiment in [Sara Sabour, Nicholas Frosst, Geoffrey E Hinton. Dynamic Routing Between Capsules. NIPS 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)  

modified from [XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras](https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras) 

Needs Keras and Tensorflow

84.5% accuracy...still working...It seems suffers from overfitting....

First run mnist_shifted to generated datasets

Then run caps2.py to train and test networks

Detailed description is coming soon...
